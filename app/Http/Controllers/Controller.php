// Controllers in HTTP frameworks, such as Laravel in PHP, handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses. They act as intermediaries between the model (data) and the view (presentation). Controllers contain the logic to process the request, interact with the model, and return the appropriate response, often rendering a view or returning data in a specific format like JSON.

// In the provided HomeController.php example, the __invoke method is a special method that allows the controller to be used as a single-action controller. When an HTTP request is routed to this controller, the __invoke method will handle the request.
